## Installing certificates

By default, the role uses the self-signed certificate that is generated when installing `mod_ssl`. If you want to use a custom certificate, put it in a subdirectory named `files/`, relative to your main playbook location. Then set the appropriate role variables. For instructions on how to set up your own (self-signed) certificates, see e.g. the [CentOS Wiki](https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Https).

E.g. you have a server key `example.com.key` and certificate file `example.com.key`. The directory structure should look:

```
.
└── files
    ├── example.com.crt
    └── example.com.key
    |__ root-certificate.crt   #examplo CA file
```

The same goes for a certificate chain file and CA certificate file. Ensure they are available in the `files/` directory, and define variables `certificate_chain_file`.


Example Playbook
----------------
---
- hosts: server

  become: yes
  
  vars:
  
    - vhost_name: "example"  # Enter the name of your vhost example: yourdomain.com and this function will create the yourdomain.com.conf and ssl.yourdomain.com.conf
    
  roles:
  
    - /path/acandid.httpd
...
